# Cryptotun – A Minimal Secure Tunneling Device

Cryptotun is a Linux kernel module that creates a virtual point-to-point network interface capable of tunneling IP packets securely over UDP, with encryption provided by AES-GCM. It's designed to act like a VPN tunnel device, but with minimal user-space dependencies and kernel-level packet processing.
