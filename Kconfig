	help
		Enable support for the Cryptotun kernel module, which provides a minimal,
		secure tunneling interface over UDP. Cryptotun creates a virtual layer 3
		point-to-point network interface capable of encrypting and authenticating IP
		packets using the AES-128-GCM cipher with SHA-256. This module handles packet
		encapsulation, decapsulation, and basic tunnel management in the kernel, while
		delegating key exchange and tunnel coordination to userspace tools.

		If unsure, say M to build as a loadable module, or N to disable.

config CRYPTOTUN_TEST
	tristate "Cryptotun Tests"
	depends on KUNIT && CRYPTOTUN
	default KUNIT_ALL_TESTS
	help
		Enable KUnit-based unit tests for the Cryptotun kernel module.

		This option allows developers to run a suite of automated tests to verify
		the internal logic and behavior of the Cryptotun implementation. It is
		useful during development and debugging, but not necessary for normal
		use of the module.

		If unsure, say N.
